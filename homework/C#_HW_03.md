Return statements terminates the execution of the method.1. A simplified form of methods that consist of a single expression.1. The scope of a variable is the region of a program where it can be used.1. If two identifiers have the same name and are declared in the same scope, they are said to be over-loaded.1. Write the name of the method and provide the necessary arguments between parentheses.1. Start with method name and arguments, don't enter a default value for mandatoryparameters. You must specify all mandatory parameters before any optional parameters.1. You specify that a parameter is optional by providing a default value for theparameter.1. You specify the name of the parameter, followed by a colon and the value to use.1. You return values with a return statement. You can return multiple values by writinga return statement that returns a tuple.1. The compiler can distinguish between the methods because they have different parameter lists.
