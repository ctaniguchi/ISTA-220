1. A contiguous block on the heap.
2. On the heap.
3. On the stack.
4. Either the type declared with the array, or the type the compiler chooses
as the best fit.
5. Declare the type and the name for the elements of the array, and in the
for each statement declare the variable name and type for the elements, followed
by the array name.
6. You make a deep copy of an array by using a For Loop.
7. A multidimensional array requires you to specify multiple index values.
8. You would choose an array of arrays when you don't need all the space created 
by a multidimensional array, and you want to save memory.
9. I would write a method that would iterate every cell in the multidimensional
array, and then create a new array and fill it with all of the elements.
10. Using a For loop will select and change only the elements that meet a certain 
condition, while For Each will iterate through every element one by one.
