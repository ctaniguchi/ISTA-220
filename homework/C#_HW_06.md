1. An exception is a signal that an error has occurred.
1. The contained statements run to completion.
1. Once a matching catch handler is found, then the handler runs and then code executes starting
with the following statement.
1. The method exits, with execution returning to the caller, which repeats the process of trying to find 
a catch handler.
1. The parent class is Exception. Exceptions are organized into inheritance hierarchies which are all contained 
within the Exception class.
1. If you use the FormatException type, you can examine properties to determine the 
cause of the exception.
1. To prevent cases of integer overflow.
1. From negative 2,147,483,648 through positive 2,147,483,647
1.  From 0 to 4,294,967,295. The difference is that an unsigned integer can only contain positive numbers. 
1. The finally block contains statements that are always executed, regardless of any
exceptions that occur.
1. If you want the program to stop after running through the try/catch block so you can work through
any thrown exceptions immediately.
