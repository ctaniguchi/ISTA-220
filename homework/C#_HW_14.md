1. The difference between a managed resource and a unmanaged resource is the garbage
collector knows about a managed resource.
2. Memory for a reference type is allocated when a constructor is called, 
it is deallocated at the ending curly brace.
3. A destructor is a special method that performs cleanup when an object is 
no longer needed.
4. Destructors don't use the new keyword.
5. Memory, database connections, file handles.
6. Ensures that a disposal method is always called regardless of exceptions.
7. The using statement block says when you are using a resource.
8. Its a waste of resources.
9. Threads are each path the code can take.
10. It doesn't wait for the garbage collection to be complete, so you don't 
know if your objects are destroyed.
