1. An interface allows you to separate the "what" from the "how".
2. Use the interface keyword. 
3. An interface cannot have variables or any fields.
4. Same way as you would a class or struct, except you never specify an access
modifier.
5. No, because interfaces can't contain constructors.
6. Yes you can.
7. A class can inherit from multiple interfaces, and it can implement multiple
interfaces by listing interfaces in a comma separated list.
8. It means to disambiguate which method is part of which interface implementation.
9. The restrictions are you can't define any fields, or constructors, or destructors.
10. Abstract classes can contain code and data, an interface does not.
11. An abstract method is similar to a virtual method, wxcept it doesn't contain a 
method body.
12. A sealed class is a class that is prevented from being used as a base class.
13. A sealed method is used so a derived class can't override this method.
