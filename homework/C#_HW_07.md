1. A class is a group of objects that share common attributes(data) and behaviors(methods).
They arrange information and behavior into a meaningful entity.
2. The two purposes of encapsulation are to combine methods and data within a class,
and to control the accessibility of the methods and data.
3. You instantiate an instance of a class by using a constructor.
4. The default access of the fields and methods is private, use the public 
keyword to change it.
5. Access modifier, constructor name, parameter list, and fields.
6. Class fields store data to be accessed by methods, methods perform actions. 
Create class fields and methods by defining them within a class.
7. Bring a static class into scope with static using statements.
8. A reason to create an anonymous class is if all you want is for it to return
information.
9. Polymorphism is the ability of objects with different types to provide a unique interface
for different implementations of methods.
10. Message passing is the sending of messages to call code to run instead of having
to call the process by name.
