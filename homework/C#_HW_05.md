1. It is a combination of an arithmetic operator and the assignment operator. It is a 
shorthand way to assign a value to a variable and perform a math operation on it.
2. *=, /=, %=, +=, -=
3. int += 5, for(int i = 0; i += 5)
int -= 50, for(int i = 0; i -= 50)
4. Until the boolean statement evaluates as false.
5. A variable that automatically acquires the value of each element in the array. The type of this variable must match the type of
the elements in the array.
6. If you don't, then it will lead to hard to bugs since not all the lines will run.
7. Initialization, Boolean expression, and code that updates the control variable.
If you omit the boolean expression, the statement keeps running. If you leave out the initialization
and update parts, its a while loop.
8. You can use a do while loop, because it evaluates the boolean expression at the end of the statement.
9. The break statement exits the switch statement.
10. The continue statement causes the program to perform the next iteration of the loop immediately 
(after reevaluating the Boolean expression).
11. When you require your application to display a menu of options.
