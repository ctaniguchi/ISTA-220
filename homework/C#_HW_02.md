1. Variables that are declared in the body of a method.
1. A command that performs an action, are combined into methods.
1. The names used to identify the elements of a program. 
1. A storage location that holds a value. A named location in memory that contains a value with a type.
1. A named sequence of statements.
1. No, because Primitive types map directly to types in the base class library 
such as int, char, double. Value type variables can be assigned a value directly.
1. The arithmetic operators you can use depends on the operands and the variable type.
1. Call the ToString method of the variable.
1. Call the System.Int32.Parse method
1. Precedence governs the order an expression's operators are evaluated
and Associativity is the direction left or right in which the operands of an operator
are evaluated. For example, if an expression has two operators with the same
precedence level, then associativity would make the expression
be evaluated from left to right.
1. You must assign a value to a variable before you can use it.
1. Increment operator adds one, decrement operator subtracts one. Operator will add one/subtract one 
depending on whether it's on the left or right.
1. A feature allowing you to concatenate strings by using the
$ sign instead of +.
1. Asks the C# compiler to infer the variable type from an expression.
